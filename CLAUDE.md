# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important

**The admin dashboard is integrated into the main Leaply-FE project, not this repository.**

This folder (`Leaply-Admin`) contains only the API specification. All implementation work should be done in:

```
/home/keishi/Code/Leaply/Leaply-FE
```

## Reference Files

- `ADMIN_FRONTEND_SPEC.md` - Complete API specification with endpoints, request/response types, and CSV import formats

## Implementation Location

The admin dashboard routes will be at:
```
/home/keishi/Code/Leaply/Leaply-FE/app/[lang]/(admin)/admin/
```

See `/home/keishi/Code/Leaply/Leaply-FE/CLAUDE.md` for full implementation details.
